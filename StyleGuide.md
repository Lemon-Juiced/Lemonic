# Quick and Simple Style Guide
Lemonic uses our QaS (Quick & Simple) Style Guide.

## Style Guide
- Use `lowerCamelCase` for variable and function names.
- Use `UpperCamelCase` for class and type names.
- Use braces `{}` for all control structures.

If discrepancies arise and need to be addressed, they will be added to the style guide.
Since the project itself is a work in progress, this is subject to change.
