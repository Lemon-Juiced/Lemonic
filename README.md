# Lemonic C

Lemonic C, or simply Lemonic, is a new derivative of C designed to simplify and enhance the language.

## What is Lemonic?
The name "Lemonic" combines "Lemon" (inspired by the developer) and "Demonic" (reflecting the challenging nature of creating this language). Although the full name is Lemonic C, it is often abbreviated to just Lemonic.

## How it Works
Lemonic relies on existing C tools, such as `gcc`.  
When a Lemonic program is compiled, it is first translated into an equivalent C program, which is then compiled using a standard C compiler.  
The file extension for a Lemonic program is `.lmc`.

### Compiler
The Lemonic compiler, `lemonicomp`, is nowhere near started.

## Progress

### Completed
- `ArrayList.c`, `ArrayList.h`, and `ArrayListTest.c`
  - ArrayList Implementation
  - Ideally, the syntax for this should be more similar to other languages, but this atleast functions as is.
- `LString.c`, `LString.h`, and `LStringTest.c`
  - String Implementation
  - Ideally, the syntax for this should be more similar to other languages, but this atleast functions as is.
- `Print.c`, `Print.h`, and `PrintTest.c`
  - Adds additional print functions.
  
### In Progress
- The Compiler: `lemonicomp.c` based off current implementation.
  - Need to add compiler flags

### To Do:
- Implementations for a lot of features.
