# Lemonic C

Lemonic C, or simply Lemonic, is a new superset of C designed to simplify and enhance the language.

## What is Lemonic?
The name "Lemonic" combines "Lemon" (inspired by the developer) and "Demonic" (reflecting the challenging nature of creating this language). Although the full name is Lemonic C, it is often abbreviated to just Lemonic.

## How it Works
Lemonic relies on existing C tools. When a Lemonic program is compiled, it is first translated into an equivalent C program, which is then compiled using a standard C compiler.

### Compiler
The Lemonic compiler, `lemonicomp`, is nowhere near started.

## Completed
- `ArrayList.c`, `ArrayList.h`, and `ArrayListTest.c`
  - Ideally, the syntax for this should be different, but this atleast functions as is.

## In Progress
- `String.c`, `String.h`, and `StringTest.c`

## To Do:
- `lemonicomp` Compiler
- New C Implementations of existing C++ features, or equivalents.
